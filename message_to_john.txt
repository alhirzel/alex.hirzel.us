I had been using this interface to pre-populate the KeyTable within ParserState
with a list of pages of my site; this makes linking between pages of my site
much easier. (Specifically, because the references are pre-defined when each
page is parsed, I do not have to define them on each page. Obvious maintenance
implications, etc.)

Do you have any advice on how I can work around this change and preserve my use case?
