Trail riding (bicycle, no snow)
-------------------------------
I am starting to get into trail riding in the Houghton/Hancock area. I have
purchased an Ironhorse mountain bike used and I am slowly building my skill in
the Pilgrim Trails behind Michigan Tech's campus. A PDF-format, up-to-date
[map of these trails][techtrails] (and [here][techtrails2]) is available on
MTU's website. Another good resource for things of this nature is [Keweenaw
Trails][keweenawtrails].

Snowshoeing (winter)
--------------------
Earlier this summer, I bought a pair of [MSR Denali Ascent snowshoes][sshoes],
which allow for some of the funnest walking I have ever accomplished. Typically,
I go on the [Maasto trails][maastotrails] for this, but I will likely expand.
