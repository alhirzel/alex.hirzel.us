These are in no order real order except that the first one, which is the most expensive and most enjoyable.

Mountain biking
---------------

I am an avid mountain biker and have ridden trails in 4 states and counting. My first bike was a Wal-Mart bike that I borrowed occasionally in 2009; it was not sized correctly and I ended up breaking multiple parts on it before picking up a used Ironhorse Sinister Sport in summer 2010. It was a relatively good investment, but design flaws and subtle problems bloomed into a host of repairs over the next year. In summer 2011 I pre-rode, entered and finished my first race, the [Keweenaw Chain Drive], which was a 16 mile cross country race on the very rough [Churning Rapids]/[Maasto-Hihto] trail network in Hancock, Michigan.

During fall 2011 I made the decision to upgrade bikes. I now own a [2012 Kona Hei Hei 29], an absolutely beautiful trail machine which has components and geometry optimized for cross country riding. I couldn't be happier (but I'm glad I didn't test-ride the [Pivot Mach 429] when [I was in Moab](/utah_2012.html) because I'm sure I'd be bike-jealous). After purchasing my Hei Hei I started riding the [Copper Harbor] trails and found that they were a blast. The [rest of the world][ch1] seems to be realizing this as well, because they were named an [IMBA epic ride].

What ever became of my Ironhorse you may wonder? I winterized it by studding the tires.

Writing in LaTeX
----------------

For most of my undergrad career I have done my homework in LaTeX and have found it to be a rewarding experience. (To be expanded.)

Camping
-------

As generic as it is, I enjoy camping. I own a bombproof tent but pay the price in weight. I have camped in the winter in a [quinzee] as well, which I would do again in a heartbeat.

Snowshoeing
-----------

In 2010 I bought a pair of [MSR Denali Ascent] snowshoes, which allowed for some of the funnest walking I had ever accomplished until I snapped one. MSR is an excellent company and despite the circumstances of the break they offered to replace the pair. There was a problem but it was easily solved.  At the time of breaking, MSR no longer made my snowshoes! Their solution was to send me a new pair of the latest shoes at that level, a significant upgrade. I now use [MSR Evo Ascent] and couldn't be happier.

I usually romp around the [Maasto trails][maastotrails], the Tech Trails or up in Copper Harbor.
