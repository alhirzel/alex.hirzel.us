title: Spring break 2012 trip

This page details the trip undertaken from [Hancock], Michigan to [St. George],
Utah (with a significant presence in [Moab], Utah) by Chris Woodry and Alex
Hirzel (this author) from March 2 thru 10, 2012. The goal of the trip was to put
miles on our mountain bikes. The hope behind posting this article is that the
detail herein may aid in the planning of future trips by us and others.


Day-by-day breakdown
====================

Day 1: Departure (March 2, 3)
-----------------------------

We departed on Friday, March 2 at 10:30am from [Hancock] with bikes on the rack.
We took off the wheels to reduce wind drag and applied WD-40 to most moving
surfaces because we were expecting rain and snow en route. Packing was tight
especially with two 26" and two 29" wheels squeezed into a 2002 Cavalier in
addition to enough gear to summit a mountain and camp for several days in the
backcountry (auxiliary goals). The back seat was dropped to better accomodate
large bags, which filled the space to the point that the only comfortable seat
was the driver seat. Normal fears that things had been overlooked subsided not
because of increased confidence in our excellent packing skills (which had been
put to the test for just a few hours before departure) but more as the distance
from home grew too great to turn around and try again.

Wisconsin went under the tires uneventfully, as did Iowa. We discovered that
most of Iowa and Nebraska were unexpectedly windy (i.e. very windy).
Coincidentally, there were hundreds of windmills that blinked red at
night; it seemed like great thought had been put into placing the windmills in
an area with strong wind (we had trouble keeping the car on the road at some
points!) While traveling through Iowa and Nebraska we found it difficult to
maintain consciousness because of the linearity of the road, uniformity of the
terrain and the fact that this section of the drive took place during normal
human sleeping hours (even for college students).

Colorado proved to be much more difficult to sleep through once we reached
Denver with snow-covered roads winding through the rocky mountains just after
the 6am (local) start of rush hour. The driving was stressful with steep climbs
and icy descents on 6% grades with dedicated escape lanes for out of control
semi trucks, a not-unlikely scenario given the conditions at that point. In
addition to the aforementioned environmental factors, Chris was driving. My
knuckles had adopted the color of the roads, skies and mountains (white, that
is).

We had high hopes to stop in Fruita, Colorado for riding at their purportedly
epic trails, including [The Edge Loop]. As we arrived in the area, I called
several bike shops in a frantic attempt to feed the inner trailhound and get
some recommendations; in doing so, I discovered that only one shop was open at
9am on a Saturday in March. I also discovered that our trip was timed a bit too
early for Fruita--they were too cold and riding at this time was uncommon ("out
of season"). This was only minorly disheartening. After we spent an hour crying
(not really), we resolved to press on to Moab.

  * Moab
  * [Poison Spider][poisonspider]
  * Hiking up cliffs, elevation impact on aerobic capability
  * Lost 2 tubes
  * Stayed at Goose Island this night, fee was $8 at site TODO


Day 2: Moab I (March 4)
-----------------------

  * Bought slime tubes
  * Promise of free Osprey bladders
  * [Moab Brand trails][moabbrands]
  * Discovered third lost tube
  * Stayed at Goose Island this night, $8 at site TODO


Day 3: Moab II (March 5)
------------------------

  * Stayed at BFE BLM (Red Rock Canyon?) outside of St. George this night (11ft 9in), recommend taking exit 22 instead of 17, which goes against Google Maps.


Day 4: St. George I (March 6)
-----------------------------

  * Biked at Bear Claw Poppy, a very smooth and enjoyable ride once some initial downhill obstacles were out of the way for this cross country rider.
  * stayed at Snow Canyon this night, $16 at site 20
  * We went to bed during some very high winds.


Day 5: St. George II (March 7)
------------------------------

  * We woke up in Snow Canyon and saw snow--apparently this is rare.
  * hiked around Snow Canyon
  * Got oil change---was hilarious (TODO: oil change story goes here)
  * stayed at Snow Canyon this night, $16 at site 20
  * Severe weather rocked us to sleep once more on this second night of wind.


Day 6: St. George III, Moab III (March 8)
-----------------------------------------

We woke up and compared memories of the night before and concluded that neither
of us were dreaming when we heard a pack of coyotes cackling across the street
after the wind finally died down. We broke camp and packed, noticing a trend
that our gear seemed to shrink each time we packed it. We explored the lava
tubes down the street.

  * Explored lava tubes at Snow Canyon, left St. George at roughly 11am. Northbound highway 15 proved to be a challenge for the Cavalier due to a headwind (in addition to the almost constant climb)
  * Drove 5 hours to Moab, set up camp, hit up microbrewery in Moab (in that order)
  * Staying at Goose Island site TBD $8


Day 7: The long, grueling return drive (March 9, 10)
----------------------------------------------------

  * Mountain biking at Moab Brands?
  * Drive home starting at 6pm


Day 8: First day back (March 11)
--------------------------------

(detail unpacking, re-adjustment)


Lessons Learned
---------------

  * Check ahead to see if biking regions are in-season in the planning stage
    (rather than the late driving stage)

  * Take people's advice on thorns (slime tubes)
