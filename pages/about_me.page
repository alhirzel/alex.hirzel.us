Contact information

I have included links to my various online profiles. My resume is available and I can provide references upon request.

Educational background
----------------------

I was homeschooled by my wonderful Mother up until high school, when we decided public school was best to round off my primary education. I attended L'Anse High School between 2005 and 2008 where I graduated valedictorian and was involved in several clubs including NHS and drama. Other claims to fame include high ASVAB and ACT sores and outscoring everyone on the AP calculus test before taking the class. I went on to attend Michigan Technological University (30 miles away) from 2008-2012 where I interspersed various internships and co-ops into my education and decided I wanted to pursue graduate school.
