Useful packages
---------------

  * The float package with the [H] option allows you to have firm "here"
    placement of figures and tables.

  * The environ package simplifes the implementation of new LaTeX environments
    by providing a `\newcommand`-esque method of defining environments using
    `#1`, `#2` and others as well as `\BODY`.
