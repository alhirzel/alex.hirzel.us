Useful/unique software
----------------------

This is a list of cool software tools I frequently use presented in the order in which I thought of them (read: there is no intended order). My rationale for creating this list is it will help other people to cut right to the meat of what's out there--right to the very best programs.

LaTeX
  ~ The best tool for creating most documents, but it has a learning curve. LaTeX (pronounced la-TEK) enables you to write in plain text and generate [good-looking PDFs][resume] for a wide variety of target audiences. The bundled templates are appropriate for many types of document/publications including presentations with [Beamer], [IEEE publication][ieeetran.sty], and the standard report and thesis work which has lifted it to dominance in the realm of academic publishing. Add-ons are numerous and include the excellent [TikZ] package, [Sweave], and many others.

[Vim]
  ~ A great text editor and my editor of choice. I am a somewhat egotistical user who takes pride in knowing more tricks than my friends. I am starting to maintain a [page of Vim tips](vim_tips.html) for the interested.

[Freemind]
  ~ Software for creating and maintaining [mind maps], a highly effective tool for organizing thoughts or projects. Freemind has a very intuitive set of default keybindings that allow you to "just use" the software from day 0.

[Web2PDFConvert.com]
  ~ A web-based HTML-to-PDF converter. It is distinct from the many other web-based tools because it treats HTML anchors correctly (i.e. generates a link within the PDF which goes to a different page rather than to the website). There is usually a better way to save web pages, but in a pinch I turn to this one.

[PDF-Shuffler]
  ~ I have contributed patches for this one. It's a great tool for those of us with an autofeeding scanner because you can easily split PDFs.

[Firefox]/[Firebug]
  ~ Makes debugging/visualizing web pages and JavaScript very easy. I used it to get a lot of the direct-download links that are on this page.

[LXAppearance]
  ~ Configure GTK themes--especially useful for those of us who don't use KDE, GNOME or XFCE.

[AltDrag]
  ~ Window resizing in Microsoft Windows is annoying once you're used to it on &lt;insert name of other GUI here&gt;. This helps.

New installation of Windows
---------------------------

Here is a list of programs that I normally install with Windows. This is mostly
for my benefit when I am reinstalling for other people. Links below are to the
canonical latest version when possible and will automatically start the
download in some cases.

  * [CCleaner], [Defraggler]
  * [Java Runtime]
  * [Acrobat Reader], [Flash]
  * [K-Lite] (and [K-Lite64] if applicable) which add support for a lot of
    audio/video codecs as well as thumbnailing for "weird" file types
  * [Picasa]
  * Another browser, such as [Firefox] or [Google Chrome]

I also make some other modifications, such as

  * Installing the Task Manager replacement <code>[procexp.exe]</code> into
    <code>C:\\WINDOWS</code> and launching it to activating
  * Drop a copy of <code>[putty.exe]</code> in thw WINDOWS directory
  * Install <code>[pagedfrg.exe]</code>
  * Change the screensaver to [Electric Sheep]
