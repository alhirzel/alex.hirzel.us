Useful/unique software
----------------------

This is a list of cool software tools I frequently use presented in the order
in which I thought of them. My rationale for creating this list is it will help
other people to cut right to the meat of what's out there--right to the very
best programs.

LaTeX
  ~ The best tool for creating documents. It enables you to write in plain text
    and generate good-looking PDFs for a wide variety of target audiences. The
    built-in templates for 

Vim

Haskell

zsh

pfsense

Git

tmux

FreeBSD

Web2PDFConvert.com - this is distinct from the other web-based HTML-to-PDF
converters I have used because it treats HTML anchors correctly (i.e. generates
a link within the PDF which goes to a different page rather than to the
website).

PDF-Shuffler
  ~ http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfshuffler/



New installation of Windows
---------------------------

Here is a list of programs that I normally install with Windows. This is mostly
for my benefit when I am reinstalling for other people. Links are to the
canonical latest version when possible and will automatically start the
download in some cases.

  * [CCleaner], [Defraggler]
  * [Java Runtime]
  * [Acrobat Reader], [Flash]
  * [K-Lite] (and [K-Lite64] if applicable) which add support for a lot of
    audio/video codecs as well as thumbnailing for "weird" file types
  * [Picasa]

I also make some other modifications, such as

  * Installing the Task Manager replacement <code>[procexp.exe]</code> into
    <code>C:\\WINDOWS</code>, activating it 
  * Drop a copy of <code>[putty.exe]</code> in thw WINDOWS directory
