This is a small collection of tips for the [Vim][vim] text editor, one of my tools of choice. Hats off to [the Vim tips wiki][vimtips], but I didn't find these there originally. When I found about most of these, I was in a situation where I figured "there *must* be a key for that"; sure enough, there was. Other items in this list were added because they seemed useful and I didn't want to forget about them.

Scroll the viewport
  ~ In Normal mode, <kbd>CTRL+U</kbd> and <kbd>CTRL+D</kbd> scroll half a viewport up and down, respectively. (I don't know how to do this in Insert mode with the default keybindings--if you do, let me know too!)

Paste in Insert mode
  ~ <kbd>CTRL+R "r</kbd>, where <kbd>r</kbd> is the register to use; a handy one is <kbd>+</kbd> for the system clipboard. This also works when entering regular expressions!

Copy the word under the cursor when the cursor is in the middle of the word
  ~ <kbd>yiw</kbd> in Normal mode (also things like <kbd>yi"</kbd> work to grab quoted text from inside, etc.)

Move the cursor to the top, middle or bottom of the viewport
  ~ Normal mode: <kbd>H</kbd>, <kbd>M</kbd> and <kbd>L</kbd> (<code>:help Q_vm</code>)

Display a list of marks
  ~ <code>:marks</code>

Execute a shell command and include the results in your document
  ~ <code>:r!ls</code> (with <code>ls</code> as an example command)

Also, some help pages are more densely packed with cool tricks than others. Read these:

  * <code>:help Q_ma</code>
  * <code>:help Q_sc</code>
