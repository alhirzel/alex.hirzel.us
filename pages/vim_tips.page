This is a small collection of tips for the [Vim][vim] text editor, one of my
tools of choice. Hats off to [the Vim tips wiki][vimtips], but I didn't find
these there. When I found about most of these, I was in a situation where I
figured "there *must* be a key for that"; sure enough, there was. Other items
in this list were added because they seemed useful and I didn't want to forget
about them.

Scroll the viewport
  ~ In Normal mode, <kbd>CTRL+U</kbd> and <kbd>CTRL+D</kbd> scroll half a
    viewport up and down, respectively. (I don't know how to do this in Insert
    mode with the default keybindings.)

Paste in Insert mode
  ~ <kbd>CTRL+R "r</kbd>, where <kbd>r</kbd> is the register to use
    (<kbd>+</kbd> for the system clipboard)

Copy the word under the cursor when the cursor is in the middle of the word
  ~ <kbd>yiw</kbd> in Normal mode (also things like <kbd>yi"</kbd> work to grab
    quoted text from inside, etc.)

Move the cursor to the top, middle or bottom of the viewport
  ~ Normal mode: <kbd>H</kbd>, <kbd>M</kbd> and <kbd>L</kbd> (:help Q_vm)
