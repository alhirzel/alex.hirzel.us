I am starting to think about grad school and my future. What I am finding is that I have a somewhat narrow focus. Specifically, it is hard for me to see what broad impact could result from research in control systems. For example, the published list of Grand Challenges from the National Academy of Engineering
lists

A good time to decide whether you want to pursue grad school is the start of your junior year of undergrad.

Choosing a school
-----------------

The Hertz Foundation maintains a [list of schools](hertz-school-list) which are deemed tenable for a recipient of the [Hertz Fellowship]. Luckily my independent searching turned up schools which are (almost without exception) on this list.  For this reason I think this list is a valuable "shortcut" list of schools to consider.
