title: Setting up tt-rss

As a replacement for Google Reader (which was given a sunset date in a few
months), I set up `tt-rss` to run on a virtual machine on my file server.
`tt-rss` is similar in functionality to Google Reader, and I made the decision
to switch to a self-hosted solution because no good alternatives to Google
Reader existed at the time Google announced the retirement of Reader.
